# Machine Learning Algorithms Practice

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms that I have practiced. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and includes a brief explanation of its purpose and usage.

## Algorithms Included

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Neural Networks

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in its own Python file. You can run these files individually to see the algorithm in action. Make sure to have the required libraries installed (e.g., NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn) before running the scripts.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have implemented additional machine learning algorithms or have suggestions for improving existing implementations, feel free to submit a pull request.
